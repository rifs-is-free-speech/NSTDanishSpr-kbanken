# NSTDanishSpråkbanken

This database was created by [Nordic Language
Technology](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/en/resource-catalogue/oai-nb-no-sbr-55/)
for the development of automatic speech recognition and dictation in Danish. 


This is not the NSTDanishSpråkbanken dataset. Rather it is an adapter to use
the data in the rifs-CLI. To use this dataset you have to add all the .wav
files to the dk folder.

## Intended use

This can be used for both training and testing.
